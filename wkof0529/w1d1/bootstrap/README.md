Bootstrap
Go to http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download to download bootstrap and choose the files you want to use within each folder. In my case i am keeping all the files as they were when I downloaded them.

Then I created an img folder, a readme.md file and an index.html file inside my root repo.
