JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a way of storing and working with data in javascript. it usually involves objects and arrays like so:
[
  {
    "name": "Meowsy",
    "species" : "cat",
    "foods": {
      "likes": ["tuna", "catnip"],
      "dislikes": ["ham", "zucchini"]
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "Barky",
    "species" : "dog",
    "foods": {
      "likes": ["bones", "carrots"],
      "dislikes": ["tuna"]
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "Purrpaws",
    "species" : "cat",
    "foods": {
      "likes": ["mice"],
      "dislikes": ["cookies"]
    }
  }
]

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a process of sending and receiving data from a server without a page reload. 
XMLHttpRequest does the heavy lifting for AJAX by establishing a continous path for the exchange of data.
